# Uncovering-the-Hidden-Half-of-Plants
This project was developed at CSE REU 2021 at Washington University in St. Louis with Professor Tao Ju, in collaboration with the Danford Science Center. 
We worked to create graphic user interface annotation software for biomedical imaging and root segmentation. 

Why is this project important?
Roots are essential to the plants growth and health, playing a crucial role to providing food for our growing population. 
By growing the corn in artificial soil in a pot, we can gather data by taking 2D slices of a 3D CT scan. 
Then, biologists need to annotate to find where the roots are in the images. The process of annotation and navigation is tedious and conversome, and currently takes biologists 8 weeks to complete. 
In an ideal world, we would have a machine learning program to find the roots.  However, to make such a program requires ground truth data, so manual annotation is still necessary.


Our goal is to create a tool that makes it easier and faster for biologists to find and annotate the roots. We believe that traveling orthogonal to the root allows for more efficient navigation and annotation. 
The code for our prototype is in the file "rootSegmentation.py". 
For a demo of the tool, click here for a video tutorial on using our prototype.
